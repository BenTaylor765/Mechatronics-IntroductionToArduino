## Assessed Exercises

There are 9 assessed exercises, each will build on a previous exercise. Six of these exercises are classed as “Basic” and we expect that all groups should be able to complete these using the three laboratory classes and maybe a little working outside the lab. These basic exercises are worth 65% of the total assessment mark. There are also three “Advances” exercises, which are an extension to the basic exercises, and **will** require extra work outside the laboratory session to complete – these are worth the final 35% of the assessment mark. 

!!! note
    You must complete **all** the basic exercises before you can gain credit for any of the advanced exercises.

The marks weighting for each exercise is provided in [Table 1](#ExWeights):

You will have three laboratory support sessions to complete these exercises, at the end of the 3rd laboratory we will stop marking. Any exercises not marked by the end of the session will not be marked. 

To complete all the basic exercises, you will almost certainly need to do a little work outside the laboratory sessions. To complete all the advanced exercises you will need to put in extra effort, outside the laboratory sessions, to fulfil the requirements.

The system has been designed, such that it is a sequential development, where each exercise builds on previous exercises, both in terms of hardware and software. This way, you do need to dismantle your circuits between exercises allowing you to work more efficiently across exercises. 

!!! note
    When you come to build the system, you can either build it all the circuitry at the start or you can build the circuitry section by section, as you progress through the exercises. Details of the mechanical and electrical systems are provided in the [Building the Robot](./RobotBuild.md) section of this site.

## Suggested Timeline for the Mandatory Exercises
<a name="Timeline"></a>
There is no rigid structure for your progress through these exercises, but the following time plan, (this is a summary of the [timeplan from the Introduction](./index.md#Timeline)) should be sufficient to ensure that you have time to complete all the basic exercises and have them marked by the GTAs before the end of the 3rd laboratory session.

<table>

  <thead>
    <tr> <th>When:</th><th>What:</th> </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr> <td>End of session 1</td><td>Robot Assembled and LED Pattern Marked</td> </tr>    
    <tr> <td>Start of session 2 </td><td>POT Calibration Angle Prepared</td> </tr>    
    <tr> <td>End of session 2</td><td>DC motor exercise completed</td> </tr>    
    <tr> <td>Start of session 3</td><td>Encoder circuit implemented</td> </tr>    
    <tr> <td>End of session 3 (Final Session)</td><td>All work completed and marked for the basic exercises</td> </tr>

If you are planning to complete the advanced exercises, you will be required to achieve these goals quicker and have any advanced exercise marked by the end of the 3rd laboratory session. Any exercises not marked by the end of the 3rd session will not be marked, and you will lose the marks for these unmarked exercises.

!!! note
    You must have completed all of the basic exercises before you can receive credit for any of the advanced exercises.
